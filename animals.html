			<font face="Dubai" color="#152425" size="+3" class="margin"><b>Panda</b></font>
			<br>
			<p class="black margin">
				Pandas are primarily endangered due to habitat loss. Humans have cleared a lot of the bamboo forest that pandas use to live. Since pandas consume only bamboo, they cannot adapt the way other species do to survive in the forests unless the pandas are fed with bamboo. Pandas often have difficulties reproducing, even in captivity, due to their excessive coziness towards their mates, their low-nutrient milk, and the fact that they normally have only one viable cub at a time. Poaching is also a panda problem, as panda skins and pelts are valuable on the black market.

			<br>
			<p class="black margin">
				Gorillas are classified as endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the reasons why gorillas are considered as endagered species is because due to habitat loss, poaching which means illegal hunting and capturing them with purpose of selling parts of their skins.

			<font face="Dubai" color="#152425" size="+3" class="margin"><b>Amur Leopard</b></font>
			<br>
			<p class="black margin">
				The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and heavy, it carries and hides unfinished kills so that other predators are not spotted. Some males have been recorded to continue with females after breeding, and may even help to raise the young. Several males often pursue and compete over a female.

			<font face="Dubai" color="#152425" size="+3" class="margin"><b>Rhinoceros</b></font>
			<br>
			<p class="black margin">
				Habitat depletion is another significant threat to rhino species. When more and more land is cleared for cultivation, there is less space for rhino to survive. Rhino requires a wide space to eat and roam. If the rhino population ends up fragmented and there are no protected 'corridors' to pass through, the likelihood of good reproduction and regeneration will drop further.

				Parrot, the name used for a wide number of gaudy, raucous birds of the Psittacidae family. Parrot is sometimes used in reference to any member of the broader group of birds, the Psittaciformes order, which also includes the Cacatuidae tribe. Parrots have been held as cage birds since ancient times, and have often been common because they are funny, intelligent, and sometimes affectionate.

			<p class="form margin">
				Hawk, some of the numerous small to medium-sized falconiform birds, especially those of the genus Accipiter, known as the true hawks, like goshawks and sparrowhawks. The name hawk is also used for other birds in the Accipitridae family (such as kites, buzzards, and harriers) and is often expanded to include some members of the Falconidae family (falcons and caracaras).

			<br>
			<p class="form margin">
				The Filipino eagle is an endangered species of eagle endemic to forests in the Philippines. It is considered the largest of the existing eagles in the world in terms of length and wing surface. The eagle has a dark profile and a creamy-brown hat. Its nape is decorated with long, brown feathers that form a shaggy, mane-like crest. The back of the Philippine eagle is dark brown, while the underside and underside are white. The strong legs are black, with wide, strong, dark claws, and the prominent, large, high arched, deep beak is bluish-gray. The eyes of the eagle are blue-gray. Juveniles are similar to adults in that the upper portion of the feathers has pale fringes.

				Dolphins are popularly known for their charm, intellect, playfulness, and friendliness to humans. Popular and bottlenose dolphins are the most commonly recognised species (Delphinus delphis and Tursiops truncatus, respectively). The bottlenose, characterized by a "built-in grin" created by the curvature of its jaw, has become a well-known performer in oceanariums.
